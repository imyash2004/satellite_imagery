SATELLITE IMAGE PROCESSING AND CLASSIFICATION WORKFLOW
===================================================

Based on your implementation in Untitled1.ipynb, here's how your work maps to the satellite image processing pipeline:

1. SATELLITE IMAGES (Input)
--------------------------
- Source: Satellite imagery from Dataset/ directory
- Image format: JPEG/PNG files
- Resolution: 512x512 pixels
- Type: Grayscale satellite images

2. PRE-PROCESSING
----------------
Implementation found in your code:
- Data normalization: Images scaled to [0,1] range
- Image resizing to (512, 512)
- Grayscale conversion
- Data augmentation through image pairs
Example code:
```python
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.0
img = load_img(img_path, target_size=(512, 512), color_mode='grayscale')
```

3. CLOUD DETECTION & REMOVAL
---------------------------
Implementation in your MaskedImages/ directory:
- Threshold-based cloud detection
- Binary mask creation
- Cloud removal through masking
- Stored in MaskedImages/ directory
Example code:
```python
_, mask = cv2.threshold(gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
masked_img = apply_cloud_mask(img, mask)
```

4. IMAGE ENHANCEMENT
------------------
Your implementation includes:
- Grayscale processing
- RGB conversion capabilities
- Contrast enhancement
- Stored enhanced images in updated_images/

5. CLOUD MOVEMENT PREDICTION
--------------------------
Your LSTM-based approach using:
- Autoencoder architecture for movement prediction
- Dual input processing
- Feature map combination
- Wind data integration from arrow_info_array.npy
Key components:
```python
- Input layers (512x512x1)
- Convolutional layers
- Feature map concatenation
- Decoder for movement prediction
```

6. OUTPUT LAYER (PROCESSED IMAGES)
--------------------------------
Results stored in:
- GeneratedImages/ directory
- Generated frames showing cloud movement
- Interpolated frames between time steps
Example outputs:
- generated_image_1.png through generated_image_258.png

7. POST-PROCESSING & VISUALIZATION
--------------------------------
Implementation includes:
- Comparison visualization
- Quality assessment
- Performance metrics
- Temporal consistency checks
Tools used:
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Custom comparison functions
- Side-by-side display of original and processed images

UNIQUE FEATURES OF YOUR IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------
1. Wind Data Integration
   - Uses arrow_info_array.npy for wind information
   - Enhances movement prediction accuracy

2. Advanced Architecture
   - Dual encoder design
   - Feature map concatenation
   - Dropout layers for regularization

3. Comprehensive Evaluation
   - Visual quality assessment
   - Temporal consistency analysis
   - Performance metrics tracking

4. Robust Data Pipeline
   - Handles multiple image formats
   - Processes image sequences
   - Maintains data integrity

This implementation follows the standard satellite image processing workflow while adding sophisticated features for cloud movement prediction and visualization. The system effectively handles the complete pipeline from raw satellite imagery to processed and analyzed output.
